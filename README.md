# AOA Algorithm Visualization

Welcome to AOA Algorithm Visualization, a website showcasing various algorithms based on different approaches in the field of Analysis of Algorithms (AOA). This project is crafted using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

## Algorithms and Approaches

Explore algorithms from different problem-solving approaches:

### Greedy Approach
- **Dijkstra Algorithm**
- **Fractional Knapsack Algorithm**

### Backtracking Approach
- **N-Queen Algorithm**

### Dynamic Programming Approach
- **0/1 Knapsack Algorithm**

### Divide & Conquer Approach
- **Merge Sort Algorithm**
- **Quick Sort Algorithm**

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository.**
2. **Open the index.html file in your browser.**
3. **Select an algorithm and approach.**
4. **Click the "Run Algorithm" button to see the algorithm in action.**
